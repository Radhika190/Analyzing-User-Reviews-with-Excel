# Analyzing-User-Reviews-with-Excel

I recently worked on a gender prediction project given by DataPlay, and the best part? I built the model entirely in Excel! ðŸ“Š
I've worked with Python and other tools before, but I had never trained a model in Excelâ€”this was a completely new and exciting challenge for me. Using pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and logic-based classification, I achieved an 83% accuracy in predicting gender based on names.

ðŸ”¹ Approach:

âœ… Performed stratified data splitting (80% train, 20% test)
âœ… Extracted the last letter of each name as a key feature
âœ… Created a pivot table to analyze gender distribution
âœ… Used VLOOKUP to retrieve probabilities and classify names
âœ… Applied IF conditions for final gender prediction

ðŸŽ¯ Business Impact:

ðŸ“Œ Helps in customer segmentation and targeted marketing
ðŸ“Œ Supports data-driven decision-making in businesses
ðŸ“Œ Shows how powerful Excel can be beyond just spreadsheets!

This experience was incredibly fun, and I loved exploring Excelâ€™s predictive capabilities!
